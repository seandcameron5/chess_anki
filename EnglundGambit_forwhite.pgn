    ( 3...d5 {Many new players to the game might play en passant because 
    it looks cool but in this case, it's best to ignore this chance.
    } 4.Bf4 {White is up a pawn and it's a central pawn. In all aspects, 
    this should be very good for White. It's critical to stabilize this 
    pawn and develop naturally.
    } 4...Bg4 5.Nbd2 {It's important to reinforce the f3-knight!
    } 5...Nge7 6.h3 Be6 7.e3 {Yet again, the e5-pawn is stable and White 
    is up a clean pawn.} )
    ( 3...Nge7 {This is an interesting idea that is relatively common. 
    It's important to consolidate the e5-pawn.} 4.Bf4 Ng6 5.Bg3 {The pawn 
    is stabilized and White is free to develop. The only way that White 
    can go wrong is if they lose the pawn but in this case, there's 
    nothing to worry about.
    } 5...Qe7 6.Nc3 Ngxe5 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.Nd5 Qd6 9.Qd4 {Black has gone all 
    out to take this pawn but will be a very high price.

    pawn, has the bishop pair and initiative. The game is simply over.} )

    known sacrifice that we will not shy away from.

    Black's position is the queen on a3 which is completely offside. White
    can proceed with natural development as Black's position is just 
    terrible.} )
