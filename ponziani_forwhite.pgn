1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 
    {The Ponziani opening is one of the oldest openings in chess history 
    and chess books as it supports an immediate d4. Although it’s rarely
    seen in tournaments, it’s very underrated as white can control the 
    centre and develop pieces quickly.}
3...Nf6 
    {Ponziani Opening, Jaenisch Counterattack
    
    With 3. Nf6, Black attacks the e4-pawn. This takes advantage of 
    White's last move, as Nc3 is no longer possible due to the pawn on c3.
    }
    ( 3...d5 4.Qa4 f6 5.d3 )
4.d4 
    {With 4. d4, White ignores the attack on the e-pawn and counterattacks
    Black's central pawn on e5.
    
    Black now has a choice - they can take the e-pawn, take the d-pawn, 
    strike in the center with d5, or defend their own pawn with d6.
    
    This is the most common line in the Ponziani opening at both beginner 
    and master level.}
4...Nxe4 5.d5 Na5 6.b4! 
    {The black knight is now trapped! White is winning}
